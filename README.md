# openqasm-fiddles
Fiddling around with Quantam computing


Run the code on the circuit composer in the [IBM Quantum Computing experience](https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/technology/experience) to see the results as well as the visual circuit that is formed because of the codes here.

I'll try and comment everything here, mostly for my future reference, but also in hopes that it will help any random voyager that lands in this repo.
